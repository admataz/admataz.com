# admataz.com src code

The source for [admataz.com](http://admataz.com) 

admataz has grown  - this is still relevant to my approach to this site. 

## TL;DR
it's my site, I do what I like. 


### This is my web site, and hereâ€™s the thinking behind it:

1. **Original**. The site reflects and records my ongoing ideas, expressions and professional work. This means regular subjective updates to the site content.

1. **Experimental**. The site code is created by me, using self-made tools over libraries and frameworks where I can. My personal site is an opportunity for learning, experimentation with my craft and developing core skills. This means regular unstable additions to the site functionality. 

1. **Minimal and progressive**. The site design, features and technology only contain what is needed. This means less structure, navigation and technical capacity. It also means less bloat. 

1. **Open**. When I produce original code for this site, I expose it, explain it and share it. 

1. **Incomplete**. It's never finished because there's always space for growth and new ideas.

1. **Mine**. I am not a client or employer. I can do what I like, break the rules and be inefficient. 

The site content resides in [src/content]('./src/content) as a mixture of markdown, json and come custom javascript. These are all built into the static wesite using [blockstatic](https://github.com/admataz/blockstatic) - a module I wrote while making this site. 

There are some other interesting front-end javascript experiments in [src/components](src/components).
