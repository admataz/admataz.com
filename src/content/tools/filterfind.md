> relevant content with a few easy clicks.

The Filterfind tools provide a way to create, manage and publish collections of content items that makes it easy to for end-users to find the content that is useful to them.  Content authors can create collections easily using the admin UI tools and an intuitive admin interface.  With tags as the structure for a faceted navigation system - users can easily drill down to the specific combination of topics within your content base that they find interesting.

Filterfind is available as a hosted service or as code hosted in your own environment, either node.js or a WordPress plugin.
