Make it easy to throw together simple charts and visualisations by uploading a CSV file or by pasting some comma-separated numbers.

AnyNumber will provide a choice of representing your numbers as:

- Line or area chart
- Scatter plot
- Pie chart
- Sparkline

Use the default colour scheme, or select your own variation.

Save your chart as an image to use in a presentation or web page, or make the chart available as embedable code.

AnyNumber is available as a hosted service, or as open source code you can host yourself.
