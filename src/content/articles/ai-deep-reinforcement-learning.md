Here we aim to gain a quick understanding of what things like Deep Learning and other AI concepts are - what they mean - and how they could be relevant to a lowly web developer. 

_reinforcement learning_ is based on current world views and world systems, e.g. road system for self driving cars. what chance do we have to change or alter the current infrastructure for something better?

as  long as humans are able to outsmart machines in complex contexts like traffic - is this an advantage? how will monitoring be used to enforce human behaviour to be machine compliant? 


- How can we as web developers get into this?
- How will learning these concepts benefit our work?
- what are some of the issues at play?
- what languages and concepts do we need to learn?
