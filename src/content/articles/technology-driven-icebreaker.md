# technology driven icebreaker

here's an idea. we still spend a lot of time feeling isolated in the presence of strangers who are probably more like us than they are different. few of us are the extrovert types that will open with a hello , yet most of us will enjoy a good conversation. 

how can you be open to people in your presence, yet protected from harm or embarrassment? once you put yourself out as the extrovert, do you become the entertainer? are the eyes on you to make the next move? 

how can the technology we use every day help overcome these barriers? how can we encourage real connections between people? and maintain agency, choice, respect and privacy... 

find the people with similar ideas right next to you. 

we have existing non technical methods that will allow us to connect. cultural signifiers. what makes some people nod and say hi to me? as if they know me, but it doesn't matter that we both know we don't. 

eye contact.
