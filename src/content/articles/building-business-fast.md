# “Copy, transform, and combine” and "speed wins"


> “Boyd’s Law, speed wins,”

Building an MVP?

> “Your goal in the early days of a startup, when you’re still validating the problem and solution,”

I have never really given much though to how simple an mvp could be. But reading *Hello Startup* talks about the idea of single landing page as a first step, before there is any hint of product development. Duh of course. You see it all the time.  Any idea, however undeveloped, can be expressed with some panache. Then it's a matter of measuring response and engaging with potential customers.

My core capability is largely implementation focused. I like the technology - but I can see the point here. And it's always refreshing to work with people who can think about the human side, and let the technology follow. 

To think about developing new ideas, I need to look at what Brikman identifies as a "copy, transform and combine" process. I do have a fear of copying - the urge is to be original. There are so many lessons to be learned. 

So. what to replicate as a seed or grain that will naturally alter to an original shape as it progresses?
