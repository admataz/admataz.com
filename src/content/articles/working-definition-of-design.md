# A working definition of 'design' for the technologist

https://overcast.fm/+QaM3u84g/06:19

which got me thinking of the relationship between what we consider design and technology. 

all very well that something is packages in a good design for people, but the engineering of technical products should also be watertight. accessibility and usability are all good, but engineering errors are unforgivable. 

what are the commercial forces that emphasise the human values of usability. is it for profit or for better experience and enhancement of the humanness of the experience. is it at the expense of engineering. 

we need engineers that understand the value of design, but that are as thorough as the geek in the lab. we need product managers to have the same approach.
