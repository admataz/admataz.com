# Clients come up with questions, we come up with answers

Dear client

Happy New Year to you too! I hope you had a good break. 

Regarding the contact form question there are several considerations, but it really comes down to how you want to manage communications with your site visitors. Generally it considered best practice to provide a contact form on your website. 

- it provides a way for visitors to make contact with you, rather than assuming visitors have access to email at all, or on the device they are using to visit your site
- Contact form submissions are captured and stored in a database on the website cms, which makes this data more accessible and manageable to your team and not just an individual owner of an inbox. This database is an accurate reflection of what's been submitted, and the person responsible for responding to queries should be checking against this (I've recommended this several times before) so you are actually less likely to miss correspondence. Personal email can also be caught in spam filters and not be delivered 
- associated with above, contact form (and media enquiries) are automatically added to Campaign Monitor/ MailChimp/ whatever if the subscribe option is selected. This would have to be a manual process and extracted from emails. 
- the specific fields of the contact form afford better management then the free form email for gathering answers to specific questions, and processing correspondence. 
- quality of communication should be better and more focused on the message being sent. We can do things like limit the length of the message. Previous administrators found email encouraged long rants and spam
- exposing an email address on the website can be a spam magnet, and the signal to noise ratio could be much lower. The form can offer some degree of human filtering, (although forms can also be subject to automated comment spam).
- there is a privacy consideration with requiring people to use an identifiable and insecure message protocol (email) and the traces that leaves. People contacting you could feasibly not want a copy in their "sent" folder. 

But if email is still your preferred option, then we can make this change. Or we can provide both, with the above considerations in mind. 

I hope that helps.
