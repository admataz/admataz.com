# Schema.org ClaimReview plugin for WordPress 

 
[This is a WordPress plugin](https://github.com/admataz/wp-factchecker-claim-review) that allows publishers to add the new  [ClaimReview - schema.org](http://schema.org/ClaimReview) schema for publishing factchecking reports to their posts. 

You can read more about the labeling of fact checking articles in [Labeling fact-check articles in Google News](https://blog.google/topics/journalism-news/labeling-fact-check-articles-google-news/).


I developed this plugin in response to a specific request from a client. I would like to see it gain some contributions from the broader community of WordPress developers and factcheckers. 

I think it's important to have this as a zero-dependency plugin, so it can have as low a barrier to adoption as possible. I have therefore not used any 3rd-party plugins for things like custom fields or JavaScript - only what is available with a standard WordPress plugin.
