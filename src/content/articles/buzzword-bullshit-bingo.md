Every meeting and conference call someone says something to make me laugh...


> "extreme personalisation"

sounds awesome

> "grooming the requirements" 

what?

> "art of the possible"

um...


> "ideation"

this is just lazy


> "best in class"
> "surprise and delight"
> "building brand engagement"

These were all said in quick succession

> "unlock the brand love"

the what?
