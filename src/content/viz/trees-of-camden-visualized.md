This visualisation experiment uses [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to show the location of trees as circles on a map of London, with the spread of the trees corresponding to the radius of the circle.

Data: [Trees In Camden - Datasets](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/trees-in-camden) - available from the [data.gov.uk open data portal](https://data.gov.uk)
