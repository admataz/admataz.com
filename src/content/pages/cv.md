### Web Developer, Technical Lead, Technologist
I write code for the server and the browser and bring experience and leadership to the teams I work with. 

I run a small consultancy, [admataz](http://admataz.com) - building websites for clients and providing contract web development services. Over the years I have had the privilege of working with a great range of people doing interesting and relevant work...

### My skills and experience
*Full stack developer* is an overloaded term - but I am equally comfortable writing the server aspects to web applications as I am on the browser. To me, the line between server and client is not a border - they are part of the same system when delivering successful products. 

#### Web programming languages and technologies
- `Node.js` for building web services and server-side applications
- `PHP` and `MySQL` for server-side application development
- `JavaScript` for browser-based web apps and enhanced interfaces

- Client-side libraries: `React`, `Redux`, `vue`, `require.js`, `jQuery`, `Dojo,js`, `Backbone`… 
- Build tools: `npm scripts`, `Webpack`, `Browserify`, `Grunt` and `Gulp`

- PHP: `CodeIgniter` and custom `Drupal` modules and `Wordpress` plugins
- Test Driven Development:  `Mocha`, `Chai`, `Sinon`, `Tape`, `Cucumber`, `Webdriver.io`
- API integrations: `GitHub`, `Twitter`, `Facebook`, `Google+`, `Google Maps`, `YouTube`, `Urban Airship`, `Vimeo`…
- Fun and experiments: `Arduino` and `JavaScript`-enabled hardware (Raspberry Pi, Espruino and Tessel)

#### Tooling, infrastructure and devops
- `Linux` web server config and management (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL)
- `Docker` Containers and `Vagrant` for development environments
- Sever provisioning: `Ansible` and `bash` scripts
- Deployment management: `Deploybot`, `Jenkins`, `gitHub webhooks`
- Hosting cloud services: `AWS`, `Rackspace`, `Linode`, `DigitalOcean`
- Project Management:  `GitHub`, `Sifter`,  `Pivotal Tracker` and `Atlassian` (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket)
- Version control and code repositories: `Subversion` and `Git`

#### Architecture, people, principles and processes

_Always learning more._

### Education

#### September 1996 - July 1997: Hoxton Bibliotech. London

- **BTEC credits - Advanced Multimedia Authoring Solutions** (Director, Lingo)

### Profile

I graduated as an environmental and geographical scientist in 1995, and I continue to visualise interactive systems as spatial entities for human interaction. The constantly evolving and emergent relationships between people, culture, location and technology are what got me excited about digital media in the first place, and still today I am not disappointed.

I find inspiration in the diversity of people around me and London has always been great for that. Now as dad to two great smart kids, I love the games, toys, play and adventures we have around town.
