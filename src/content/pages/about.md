# admataz

## About admataz.com
[admataz.com](http://admataz.com) is my personal and business portfolio website. It's an ongoing project where I experiment with code, design and words. It has been through many different versions and for what itâ€™s worth, there's a [site manifesto](/notes/site-manifesto). 

This site is generated by [Blockstatic](https://github.com/admataz/blockstatic), a minimal and experimental static site build tool I wrote in using [node.js](http://nodejs.org).


## About Adam Davis
### Web Developer, Technical Lead, Technologist

As a graduate environmental and geographical scientist, and these days as a software developer, I continue to visualise the world and interactive media as _spaces_ for human interaction. We move through constantly evolving and emergent landscapes that are shaped by relationships between people, culture, location, data and technology. This is my world. 

The diversity of people around me is inspiring and having chosen London as my home I am not disappointed. Now as dad to two great smart kids, I love the games, toys, play and adventures we have around town.

## Images and Typography

The graphics on this site, apart from project screenshots, are almost entirely code generated.  
 - The graticule background pattern is SVG, generated from code that is part of the awesome [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) project. 
 - The admataz logo is the longest lasting design element here - I have been using something similar to this logo since about 2000. The type is based on an old Mac Classic font I had called "Game Over". I discovered the scan lines rendered very cleanly at high resolutions, which made it useful to overlay on textured backgrounds and photo imagery, which was all the rage at the time. 

I have many times disassembled and reassembled each character. The version you see above is compiled using javascript from an array of binaries like those you see mapping tile games, into the SVG render: 

```javascript 
      var admataz = [
      '0000000000011000000000000000000110000000000000000',
      '0000000000011000000000000000000110000000000000000',
      '0111110001111011111100011111011111100111110111111',
      '1100110110011011010110110011000110001100110000110',
      '1100110110011011010110110011000110001100110001100',
      '1101110110011011010110110111000110001101110011000',
      '0110110011111011010110011011000110000110110111111'
    ];
``` 

is dutifully rendered as: 

<div id="svg-logo"></div>

<p class="codepen" data-height="343" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="admataz" data-slug-hash="PooqgoJ" style="height: 343px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="admataz svg">

#### Type for the headings is a webfont called [TravelingTypewriter](http://www.dafont.com/carl.d1364) by [Carl Krull](http://www.carlkrull.dk/)

Type for regular body copy is [Museo Slab](https://typekit.com/fonts/museo-slab) by [exljbris Font Foundry](http://www.exljbris.com) and thanks to Adobe Typekit and my Creative Cloud account. 

I continue to tweak the graphics and typography of this site because it's never quite right.
