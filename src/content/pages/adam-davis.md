## Profile
I graduated as an environmental and geographical scientist in 1995, and I continue to visualise interactive systems as spatial entities for human interaction. The continually evolving and emergent relationships between people, culture, location and technology are what got me excited about digital media in the first place, and still today I am not disappointed.

Over the years I have extended myself to interaction design, information architecture, education, game design, business strategy and project management, but at the core has always been the mechanics of web technologies: code, data and people. I love the web: to a technologist like me it is a giant puzzle and playground. And as a platform for people, ideas and culture, it is my passion.

I find inspiration in the diversity of people around me and London has always been great for that. Now as dad to two great smart kids, I love the games, toys, play and adventures we have around town.
