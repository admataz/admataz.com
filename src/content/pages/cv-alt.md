### Profile

I graduated as an environmental and geographical scientist in 1995, and I continue to visualise interactive systems as spatial entities for human interaction. The constantly evolving and emergent relationships between people, culture, location and technology are what got me excited about digital media in the first place, and still today I am not disappointed.

I find inspiration in the diversity of people around me and London has always been great for that. Now as dad to two great smart kids, I love the games, toys, play and adventures we have around town.
