Given I spend most of my day writing software, or I am at least facilitating and thinking about it, I am naturally interested in the effect of technology on society and culture. The ethics and politics of tech reach far and deep. It's global and personal mixed together, from the economy of nations to our privacy and our aggregated behaviours. How much do we control? How much can we affect?

Here are some recent thoughts and reading that have caught my attention: 

## Anthropic Capitalism And The New Gimmick Economy

This is worth a read:
> Capitalism and Communism which briefly resembled victor and vanquished, increasingly look more like Thelma and Louise; a tragic couple sent over the edge by forces beyond their control. What comes next is anyoneâ€™s guess and the world hangs in the balance.

## the problem with DRM 

Cory Doctrow is always interesting to read or listen to. Here he talks about his work around DRM and privacy. 

> that's why we shouldn't design things that require us to trust people in the future.

## robots vs humans vs environment vs nature
This is a thought I had for a model or visualisation. I will expand on this at another time.
