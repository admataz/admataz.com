When I wrote about [problems I perceived with React.js](/notes/react-everywhere) in 2017, I saw it as a potentially over-dominant paradigm in the minds and activities of web developers. For recruiters and managers it was an easy box to tick. It was a honey trap.

With time, my perceptions have evolved. React is probably more popular and dominant now than ever, but my fear of vendor lock-in has subsided. Using React daily at work has taught me new things about JavaScript.  I have grown to value its place in my UI developer toolbox.  More broadly I have grown to appreciate the React patterns and paradigms, and its ecosystem and the contribution its active communities make to my better use of JavaScript generally.

The [patterns that inform React's design](https://reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html), and the approaches to using React have high interoperability with the rest of my tech stack. I am now more familiar with patterns like composition and other functional programming concepts. I now make better use of modern idiomatic JavaScript. I now understand better some of the design decisions and trade offs that go into developing a reactive UI with state management. These are not concepts unique to React. But React's role in bringing the conversations forward, and educating developers is clear.

I use React daily, but not exclusively.  I like to experiment with other frameworks and ideas. But I think I am a better developer for the presence of React in my universe, if I'm using it or not.

Well for now, at least. Will check again in a couple years timeâ€¦
