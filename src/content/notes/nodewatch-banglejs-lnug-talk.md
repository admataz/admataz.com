> The worldâ€™s first hackable open source JavaScript-powered and TensorFlow-powered smartwatch

[Nodewatch/ Bangle.js](https://nodewatch.dev)  was [introduced as the conference badge](https://www.nearform.com/blog/bangle-js-hackable-oss-js-and-tensorflow-smartwatch/) at Nodeconf EU in November. A [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gfw/banglejs-the-hackable-smart-watch) that followed was swiftly funded. 

I had received my watch from NearForm in the post (employee benefits!) - and I didn't know what to do with it yet.  But too good not to share for a quick lightning demo at [LNUG](https://lnug.org).
