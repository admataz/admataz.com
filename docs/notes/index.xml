<p>Here I explain the information architecture and server-side technical challenges I faced setting up new organisational structures in a Drupal site to tackle the issue of accessing older content.</p>
<h2 id="drupals-taxonomy-system">Drupal&#39;s taxonomy system</h2>
<p>Drupal makes it easy to tag and categorise content using Drupal&#39;s native taxonomy module. Custom vocabularies, Taxonomy Fields, and Content Types provide the tools to design a fluid and emergent &#39;bottom-up&#39; organisation to content: structure emerges from the qualities and properties of the content.</p>
<p>Providing end-user access to this fluid structure is less straight forward. While a list of all content tagged with a single particular term works easily out the box, getting combinations of multiple terms is not. We needed to provide a list of articles of Type A, that cover Topic B, and have been tagged with Tag X, Y and Z.</p>
<h2 id="a-form-of-faceted-classification">A form of Faceted classification</h2>
<p>Information architects call what we are trying to do &#39;Faceted classification&#39; - topics expose &#39;facets&#39; to a body of content, and combinations of topics quickly reveal the intersections, and help users to cut a large body of content down to the relevant items.  </p>
<p>Technically in the relational database world behind Drupal, this involves composing a series of joins in our queries that return the relevant content nodes. We wrote a custom module to do this the way we wanted.</p>
<h2 id="we-want-nice-urls">We want nice URLs</h2>
<p>Foremost in our decision to write our own custom module was the importance of meaningful URLs. The Views module supports multiple arguments in a Taxonomy-based query - but they need to be numeric  - something along the line of <code>/filter-base/123+234+321</code> We wanted URLs to reflect the content and context being queried, something more like <code>/filter-base/type-a/topic-x/tag-y</code>.</p>
<h2 id="nodes-as-context-bases">Nodes as context bases</h2>
<p>We also wanted to be able to attach this &#39;contextualised&#39; capability to nodes within the site structure, so we could do something along the lines of <code>/main-topic-node/any/combination/of/topics</code> where &#39;main-topic-node&#39; is a normal page node, and the URL segments provide the basis to produce a list of relevant and filtered articles for that node. These main topic nodes were to be managed by editors via the CMS (ruling out custom <code>hook_menu()</code> implementations), and to sit at the first segment of the URL.  </p>
<p>Drupal does not make this kind of dynamic URL routing easy. The path module will map a user-friendly URL to an internal path (like <code>node/123</code>), but doesn&#39;t support adding parameters after the path.</p>
<h2 id="our-custom-drupal-module-for-providing-contextual-base-nodes-and-url-parameters-for-filtering-content">Our custom Drupal module for providing contextual base nodes and URL parameters for filtering content</h2>
<p>To simplify slightly, our custom module does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <code>hook_install()</code> it defines new custom fields that allow us to define whether a node should act as a &#39;contextual base&#39; to lists of other nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In <code>hook_menu()</code> we gather all nodes with the above &#39;contextual base&#39; flag set, and override the menu callback with a custom function. To keep this up to date, it&#39;s worth rebuilding the menu when saving nodes of the type that could be contextual bases.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With a custom route and callback defined, we are able to access extra segments in the URL as parameters, and use them to run queries against the <code>taxonomy_term_data</code> and <code>taxonomy_index</code> tables to get a list of relevant nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We add the list of relevant nodes to the current node as a property, that can then be picked up in theme templates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In our development of the module, we also added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>integration with search, so users could search within a context</p>
</li>
<li><p>and we generated lists of links for the selected and  available taxonomy terms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the additions in this last point, we were able to provide a faceted navigation to the content of the site. Users could select relevant terms from the various vocabularies, and the page would refresh with a shorter list of articles, a shorter list of remaining terms relevant to the results, and the list of selected terms (also reflected in the URL path). It made it very quick to drill down to a specific cross section of site content, and provided an intuitive interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting here that URLs are being generated with segments in any order but providing the same content. So <code>/type-a/topic-x/tag-y</code> would produce exactly the same page results as <code>/topic-x/tag-y/type-a</code>. This is not such a problem from a user&#39;s perspective, but isn&#39;t good for SEO. We need to define a canonical path for search engines to avoid penalisation here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="next-steps-improvements-to-the-client-side">Next steps: improvements to the client-side</h2>
<p>All this is good, but we found there is room for improvement:  The full page refresh for each click of a tag feels like an expensive investment for users so we started looking at ways to load the results faster...</p>
<p>In Part Two we explain how we overhauled this feature to provide a fast-loading interface using Backbone.js.  </p>

I needed to recover from a series of difficult projects for clients - the  familiar scope-creep, the many late nights (again), the high-stake expectations and the changed requirements.  And of course, the late payments. I discovered running a small business meant a lot more than providing the skills of a web developer for hire -  delivering successful communications projects for clients required deeper interrogation of the entire business structure and operation. What starts as budget for a two month project building a website stretches into a 6 month strategic consultancy.  I needed a break, and I had the offer of a six-week contract working on-site for a department store House of Fraser&#39;s ecommerce site in the West End which I accepted.  One thing led to another, and 12 months later I finally emerged, ready again for business.</p>
<p>And so it was then that I learned another valuable lesson in business: without momentum and ongoing self promotion and keeping the business profile active and alive - it&#39;s difficult to get off to a cold start. Where I was drowning under client demands a couple years earlier - I couldn&#39;t drum up a paid project from any new clients. I had put myself out of the loop.</p>
<p>Panic stations. Back to contract work…</p>
<p>It was at this time I was rejected by an agency recruiter who was little older than my years in this business - on the basis that my experience as a web developer counted little against the latest new JavaScript library. He said I needed to show I had React.js &quot;in production&quot;. React had ascended sharply in popularity in 2017 - the months I was under cover of contract work rescuing a legacy JQuery project.  I don&#39;t know if it was really the React requirement, or just bad timing, but finding a contract was proving more difficult than I&#39;d hoped.</p>
<p>I know that finding work is a little bit about luck, and about meeting the right people at the right time, and keeping options open and conversations going, and keep on keeping on.  But every day that went by without positive leads, no matter how experienced or full of self belief I may have been, felt like a knock. I was beginning to worry.  </p>
<p>And indeed it was a casual conversation at the pub that turned things around.  My friend Simon, one of the co-organisers at LNUG said after one meetup that he&#39;d put a word in for me at his company - they were often hiring. OK. Sounded good. A couple email exchanges and an interview later,  I was hired on a new contract as a remote developer at <a href="https://nearform.com">NearForm</a> -  one of the best companies and working arrangements I could imagine.</p>
<p>NearForm is stacked with amazing developers, some of whom are working on core parts of the open source technologies we use daily. Joining the team and working with such talent has been a brilliant boost for me. The two and half years have seen some hard work - I have learned more than any other workplace - and I have loved every day of work since joining.</p>
<p>Working remote with a team distributed across the world has been a learning curve on its own - the etiquette of video meetings takes some getting used to, the Slack channels need to be tamed, the languages and accents of co-workers need to be understood- and all without direct eye contact and body language…   Technical problems can fester if we don&#39;t reach out for help and clarification - and as soon as we do team members are there to help each other.  NearForm work hard as employers to keep the human side alive - and to keep it interesting. Working remotely can be lonesome   and we make sure to support each other.  We meet annually as a company and sometimes more often as teams. We are encouraged to keep life and work in balance. We are valued and trusted.</p>
<p>This is my life as a developer now. In balance.</p>
<p><a href="https://admataz.com">admataz</a> lives on as my online monicker and the place for me to share my ideas and experiments with code.</p>

That is poetry. </p>
<p>Coders are makers. Coding and computational thinking (and probably engineering generally) have become dominated by corporate thinking. Computer scientists and engineers are trained and encouraged to think like a part of the production line, to become framework administrators, and feel comfort in the obfuscation of their craft, keeping computer programmers an exclusive bunch, separate from real society. But there is something more personal, expressive and nuanced in the potential of code. </p>
<p>Code is a craft that can be mastered, but is not the exclusive domain of masters. Open source knowledge, code and hardware and a general accessibility to coding ability means more and more programs will be written to answer more everyday human needs. A critical mass will place the tools in more expressive minds. Can anything other than human expression emerge? </p>
<p>But as art? How do you measure and assess that? The existence of a canon? It’s early days for silicon-based computational thinking, but the thinking that goes into abstracted computation and programming has a rich history tracing back to Ava Lovelace and beyond. </p>
<p>As a form, computer programs live at multiple layers: Firstly the raw code, mostly private and sometimes shared with others that understand. Code allows space for comment, in-jokes, references and as a form in itself, pure beauty. Then the published program, where no code is visible, running on desktop, a phone or on the web is only complete when someone is using it. Then it becomes a thing of human interaction and unpredictable outcome. When a person is enabled, in human value terms, by the program you wrote, or one they wrote themselves… it’s a beautiful thing.  </p>

The CMS allows the writers editors to do what they do best; once the site is launched they can keep it up to date with great new articles and pages.  Bar the odd support call and feature addition, the web developers can be left to tend to their yachts. Everyone wins. Or so the theory goes. </p>
<p>One of the most compelling arguments for using Drupal on a project is it&#39;s built-in admin interface. Drupal provides the an extendible framework for user management, permissions, site structure set up, and day-to-day content management. With many of the core concerns of interface design and security seen to, Drupal developers can extend functionality and retain consistency within the admin part of the site. </p>
<p>Drupal, and many other CMS&#39;s, are built around a database. The admin interface to the CMS allows privileged users to change the content of the database, which is then reflected on the public view. In this model of publishing and Content Management changes such as new articles, or updates to the existing pages are all immediately available on the public site. For most websites this is good - it makes publishing easy and fast. </p>
<p>In some cases though, this immediacy is not desirable, and content is required to go through a &#39;staging&#39; preview process before being published and made available to the general public. Separation of the tasks of editing content and publishing it is  a requirement.</p>
<h2 id="in-drupal-theres-a-module-for-that-called-deployment">In Drupal there&#39;s a module for that called Deployment.</h2>
<p>If you need to do this, it&#39;s worth checking out the Deployment module - which aims to meet the requirement of separating editing from publishing. Deployment allows you to assign different Drupal websites as source and destination, and provides ways of synchronising their content.  We liked what it said it would do, but for the project that needed it, it wouldn&#39;t work  - no matter how we tried. </p>
<h2 id="drupal-as-a-static-site-generator">Drupal as a static site generator</h2>
<p>If Deployment doesn&#39;t work for your content either - or your content is simple enough - it may be worth considering how important it is to have a full Drupal installation on your live site at all. Drupal could, with some clever scripting, be set up to be a static site generator - and effectively publish HTML content to another site without the live site needing a database at all. Obviously this won&#39;t work where you need Drupal features such as Users, Search, or any dynamic loading of content.   </p>
<h2 id="our-solution-repurposing-the-nodeexport-module">Our solution: Repurposing the NodeExport module</h2>
<p>NodeExport is a Drupal module that serialises content and allows you to import it again. It can be useful when manually migrating content across sites, or when upgrading a site. We found we could access the relevant methods from NodeExport for exporting content on the source server, and re-importing it on the live destination server. Our solution was to write a custom module that wrapped this and the data transfer and provided editors an automated publishing process. </p>
<p>We could then get back to sailing our yacht. </p>

But sometimes you just have to suck it in and do the best you can with what the client wants...</p>
<p>We made our start with a Drupal 7 minimal install profile and used a number of contributed modules to provide the bulk of the required functionality, with some enhancements via custom coded modules. </p>
<h2 id="views-content-based-restful-server">Views content based RESTful server</h2>
<p>These are the core and contributed modules we used to set up the base RESTful service:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ctools</code> - a low level module with an tools required by other modules</li>
<li><code>entity</code> - provides and API for defining and managing custom Entities </li>
<li><code>entityreference</code> - provides the ability to build relationships between entities </li>
<li><code>features</code> - allows us to package configurations and dependencies</li>
<li><code>field_ui</code> - core module for adding fields to entities</li>
<li><code>file</code> - core module for allowing uploads to entities</li>
<li><code>image</code> - core module for managing image content</li>
<li><code>inline_entity_form</code> - interface for adding related entities within the &#39;parent&#39; entity edit form</li>
<li><code>list</code> - core field input module</li>
<li><code>module_filter</code> - interface enhancement for managing modules</li>
<li><code>number</code> - core input field</li>
<li><code>options</code> - core input field</li>
<li><code>rest_server</code> - provide a RESTful server as part of services</li>
<li><code>services</code> - module to manage web services endpoints and output formats</li>
<li><code>services_entity</code> - module to make custom entities available to services</li>
<li><code>services_views</code> - module to make views available to services</li>
<li><code>taxonomy</code> - core module</li>
<li><code>views</code> - essentially a query builder with some output formatting</li>
<li><code>views_ui</code> - interface for managing views</li>
</ul>
<p>The data output for the services endpoint in this application is defined in queries built using Views.</p>
<h2 id="drupalisms">Drupalisms</h2>
<p>Using these tools has some drawbacks. If you&#39;re used to building RESTful services closer to the metal, may come as a shock. </p>
<ul>
<li>all returned values are strings. The iOS devs hate it when their IDs are not numeric. We eventually did some post-processing to the JSON as it really did improve client side performance. </li>
<li>strings are escaped for HTML output - so entities like ampersands and special chars are represented as XML friendly (e.g. <code>&amp;amp;</code> for &amp; and <code>&amp;#039;</code> for apostrophes). This  reflects what Drupal considers normal output. </li>
<li>empty properties are sometimes presented as an empty array, even if the expected non-empty property should be a string (or stringified number). Words fail me on this one.</li>
<li>related content types are problematic to embed - so normal &#39;hasmany&#39; or &#39;belongsto&#39; relationships one can get easily from an MVC framework are not available. This potentially means more queries to the server than desired, which can be problematic for low bandwidth situations on mobile.</li>
<li>last modified is a unix timestamp - can&#39;t seem to be able to format the output as a date</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dont-try-this-at-home">Don&#39;t try this at home.</h2>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend using Drupal to build web services. We took a contributed module approach with the hope that this would provide more stability in handover to the client. I&#39;m still not sure about this - I think we could have achieved better control if we had done less &#39;the Drupal way&#39; and trusted our code query the database and output the raw json, without dressing it up Views and the CMS interface, and introducing a level of cruft to the output. If you have the option to use other PHP tools, or Ruby on Rails, or something like Restify on node.js - I would recommend it. </p>

This was a a bigger job than we had anticipated - but on reflection still the right thing to do.   </p>
<h2 id="you-cant-just-click-the-upgrade-to-drupal-7-button">You can&#39;t just click the &quot;Upgrade to Drupal 7&quot; button</h2>
<p>Automatic scripted updates are a nice idea - particularly as they are relatively effortless and repeatable. There are some good tools with Drush that will help with your migration from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7.  They are not straightforward, and will not leave you with a complete migration - there will still be manual work to do - but they help get you started. </p>
<p>The biggest problem we found with automated update scripts is that they also migrate our junk - the old ways of doing things from before we knew better, or were hacks to get around the limitations of Drupal 6. A large proportion of the value of a site redesign to us is the renewal aspect: a chance to improve the code and make things work better.  If upgrading a major version of Drupal is like moving house - automatic updates is leaving the movers to do your packing without sorting out what you want to take first.</p>
<p>The site was going through some major changes to the theme, architecture and functionality so we could justify a larger site rebuild. This has given us the opportunity to clean up things, and apply some better practices we had learned over the years.</p>
<h2 id="migrating-content">Migrating content</h2>
<p>With a fresh base install on a new version of Drupal, the challenge turns to migrating content. There is a contributed a module called Migrate, which has support for scripting Drupal-to-Drupal migrations of content, but I could not get me head around it, so I wrote my own set of database migration scripts using node.js. It took some learning of the inner mechanics of Drupal&#39;s database but eventually I came up with a set of scripts that could be re-run at any point during the new site development to bring the latest live content to the dev version.</p>
<p>Here are the steps we took to migrate the site:</p>
<ol>
<li>consolidation/prep phase</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>run some predefined SQL manually to get rid of some content I did not want to migrate (this was particular to the site in question)</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1014522#comment-6458448">consolidate all features</a> after applying <a href="https://drupal.org/files/features-consolidate-1014522-75.patch">this patch</a> to deal with some problems when using Features.</li>
<li>We were using multigroups for repeatable field groups in CCK and Drupal 6. It was only available in an alpha version of CCK, and was bound to make us suffer later. The D7 way is to use a module called Field Collection, which sets up entities as fields. To migrate multigroups to Field Collections we first had to turn them into normal ungrouped fields. We would later run a script to put them into Field Collections for Drupal 7. </li>
<li>disable unused and incompatible modules. There&#39;s no point in migrating stuff you don&#39;t want. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-the-upgrade">Do the upgrade: </h2>
<ul>
<li>enable update module if it&#39;s not enabled <code>drush en update</code></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/drush_sup">Drush Site Update</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/drush_sup.git/blob/refs/heads/7.x-2.x:/README.txt">Follow these instructions</a></li>
<li>run this command: <code>drush sup @upgrade_profile_name --core-unmodified</code></li>
<li>this <em>should</em> go without hitch - and only a few confirmation steps, if any</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="run-some-post-migration-tasks">Run some post migration tasks</h2>
<ul>
<li>new D7 modules we identified as appropriate for the new site are installed</li>
<li>any remaining CCK migrations and content type definitions that did not come through ok </li>
<li>Taxonomy vocabs are all auto-named in their machine name - need to be renamed manually if you want them to be meaningful</li>
<li>Related to above - Fields referring to Taxonomy vocabs need to be renamed</li>
<li>We wrote a script to do this (see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1130386">this post</a>)</li>
<li>Convert all references to entity references. NOTE: doing this in drush also converts all taxonomy fields by default, which is not desirable - if it has to be done in drush do each field manually - otherwise use the gui</li>
<li>PathAuto alias patterns need to be reset to D7 tokens</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-migration-content-migration-scripts">Post migration content migration scripts</h2>
<p>At this point we have a working version of the site structure and content on a new site based on Drupal 7. It&#39;s not perfect or complete, but it runs, and is a good base to continue development of new themes and modules. To give us the freedom to develop and get this right, we wrote some scripts that enable us to empty the new site of all content, and re-import everything from the old site. In theory, being scripted,  this can be run regularly during development to keep the content of the two versions of the site in sync while development continues. </p>
<h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Yes. Drupal 6 was showing its age, and the benefits of Drupal 7 and our improved knowledge of it make it an easier platform for us to write good code. I am happy with how the fresh clean slate we have in a new version without so much cruft. We are now monitoring and improving performance of the site.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/">Girls Not Brides</a> is a global partnership of more than 400 civil society organisations from over 60 countries working to address child marriage. The <a href="http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage-theory-of-change/">Theory of Change</a> is informed by the knowledge and experience of more than 150 Girls Not Brides members and experts about what it will take to end child marriage.</p>
<p>In collaboration with digital strategist, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/adam-brown/15/85/419">Adam Brown</a>, we devised and developed an interactive version of the Theory of Change that makes it a valuable tool in the organisation’s media toolkit.</p>

<p><a href="http://pictographic.io/viz/cities-of-the-world/"><img src="/assets/images/articles/cities-of-the-world.png" alt="Global cities of the world visualised"></a></p>
<p>I started this project as a tool-sharpening exercise. My goal was, after a recent hiatus from data visualisation work, to get to know some of the tools again, and get my head back into dealing with data - the processes of sourcing, cleaning, exploring, wrangling and transforming into something visual and interactive.</p>
<p>The end result is not perfect - but it has suited my purposes, and at this point I&#39;m willing to leave it as it is and move on to the next thing.</p>
<h2 id="the-global-cities-data">The Global Cities data</h2>
<p>I found this collection of city data at the Greater London Authority <a href="http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/global-city-data">London Datastore</a>, and it apparently originates from the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ia/gprb/html/global/global.shtml">New York City Global City database</a>. The data from the Excel spreadsheet itself isn&#39;t perfect, or complete. (I have my suspicions about figures like Prague&#39;s 2,011 Major Ports for instance).  For a more complete explanation of the figures, their units of measurement, and what they mean it&#39;s worth looking at the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ia/gprb/html/global/global.shtml">New York City Global City database</a> and the cited sources. For my purposes, this collection of numbers was enough for this experiment - but a better annotated and labeled version would be required to make this a full piece of data-driven communication.  </p>
<h2 id="dataviz-tools-and-libraries">Dataviz tools and libraries</h2>
<p>The main purpose here was for me to exercise the tools.  My intention at the outset was to only use <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a> to process the data and transform it to <code>SVG</code> or <code>DOM</code> elements for display - but I found I wanted something with better DOM manipulation and some kind of component or template capability so I could define a basic city, and load in the data. So I experimented with for a while <a href="http://ractivejs.org">Ractive.js</a> components and its <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a>  templates, which I&#39;ve enjoyed using before. But once I was down the component route I thought it would be interesting to take the plunge and try out <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>, which is new to me. Eventually, I found the only use I had for D3.js was the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale">scale functions</a> - and I was pleased to discover how modular the upcoming release of D3.js is, and how the library components is in the process of been decoupled - which fits far better with my workflow.</p>
<p>So I settled on a React and D3.js combination, bundled using <a href="http://browserify.org">Browserify</a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel&#39;s</a> React and ES2015 filters, with some <a href="https://lodash.com">lodash</a> to help with some maps and filtering.</p>
<h2 id="wrangling-the-data">Wrangling the data</h2>
<p>In some <a href="http://datastori.es">podcast</a> or blog somewhere in my recent research I picked up a link to <a href="https://www.trifacta.com/">Data Wrangling &amp; Exploratory Analysis Platform | Trifacta</a> - which impressed me with it&#39;s ability to digest the initial Excel spreadsheet, which was divided into sections. Trifacta is a really good product but it couldn&#39;t do everything. I resorted to Excel to transpose the rows to columns, and to some manual search and replace to fix some of the data. I had particular problems with the mixed datatypes on some columns (<code>null</code> or missing data was indicated with a <code>-----</code> which caused the whole column to be exported as <code>String</code> data and played havoc with d3&#39;s scaling functions or lodash&#39;s min/max functions, ordering data alphabetically rather than numerically.   I fired up Mr Data Converter a couple times - but I don&#39;t think it was actually required (but helped examine the data in optional formats).</p>
<h2 id="representing-the-data">Representing the data</h2>
<p>I had a mental image of this visualisation from the moment I saw this dataset:  the ability to see at a glance all the cities&#39; proportions at once and to be able to depict broad comparisons. Somewhere between Tufte&#39;s <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php/Small_Multiples">small multiples</a> and Hans Rosling&#39;s <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/">bubble charts</a>.</p>
<p>My idea here is simplicity and limiting the view to single facets of the data to highlight comparison.</p>
<h2 id="technical-issues-with-the-representations">Technical issues with the representations</h2>
<p>I hit some issues with the accuracy of the representation, mostly indicating my rustiness with visualisation techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>in my initial version I made the data correspond to the radius of the circle. This is a novice mistake and something all beginner texts on visulisation warn you against. I realised my mistake, and adjusted this so the area of the circle relates to the quantity represented.</li>
<li>I had created padding around the circles to give them some space - but this created problems with the size - and the circles weren&#39;t showing the variation I expected.</li>
<li>Some of the <code>null</code> values where data for when a city&#39;s data was unavailable was being counted in the scaling calculation. This skewed the resulting visualisations, and made the differences between some cities look less significant. An example was the Life Expectancy figures - when the null values were included, anything above 50 looked pretty good. But when I removed the null items from the scale, the difference between 54 for Johannesburg and 82 for Copenhagen is much more noticeable.</li>
<li>I had further problems with the lowest values in a set because of the way I scaled the data - and were showing up as zero, and not drawing a any circle. I adjusted my scale to be from <code>3</code> to <code>100</code> instead of <code>0</code> to <code>100</code> so something shows for the lowest item - perhaps there are better ways to do this?</li>
<li>I made a later adjustment, converting the data representation from <em>ordinal</em> to <em>quantitative</em>. Initially each city&#39;s data was represented on a relative scale from 1-100 for the active data set. This let to poor representations. A range of 50, 55, 60 was represented as a very small dot, a medium size circle, and a full size circle. I adjusted this so values are scaled to a proportion of the maximum value in the set, and keeping it zero based.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problems-with-the-visualisation">Problems with the visualisation</h2>
<p>The visualisation shows how cities compare by scaling the real numbers and using the same visual language for a range of data groups. This potentially distorts perceptions of the numbers themselves. London&#39;s 5 major airports are represented by the same size circle as Tokyo&#39;s 34.99 million Metro population, and Lagos&#39;s 85 per 1000 Infant deaths. They are all maximums in their respective sets, but clearly are not of equal value.</p>
<p>The visualisation gives the user an idea of how numbers for a data category spread across other cities included in the group - but it doesn&#39;t account for cities not there - so it is not a complete set. Nor does it try to portray the internal relationships of the data within the individual cities. So there is no way of building a reasonable representation of a city or its overall character from these visualisations.</p>
<h2 id="some-ideas-for-extending">Some ideas for extending</h2>
<p>I had some ideas… maybe one day I&#39;ll get to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Geography: positioning the city circles on a global map instead of a grid. How would this affect comparison? Would there be overlap in dense the denser metropolis areas that would obscure the representation? I thought a compromise may be to allow users to click or hover over each city to reveal a pop up panel with a map and some other non-numeric data.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Comparison:  I experimented with allowing users to select a second data set for comparison, represented by a second circle with a different colour. But the result was confusing clutter, and the initial simplicity was lost. It also raised questions visually - indicating some connection between the different data where the circles overlapped, which there was none. I&#39;m sure there are ways to explore the correlations  between the data for each city  - but that&#39;s a different visualisation.</li>
</ul>

It encourages an approach to developing interfaces that takes much of the mental hoop-jumping out of our day-to-day development tasks. It allows us to be more productive and creative. We get more reliable code than we could with jQuery-event-DOM-AJAX-eventlistener-spaghetti. Win. Win. Win. This is what libraries and frameworks should do for us, and React does it well.</p>
<p>My experiments with React have been rewarding. I enjoy writing apps with React - it suits my way of subdividing problems into smaller modular pieces and recomposing them as a whole. The functional programming paradigm it encourages is well suited to what we do as web developers - and exposure to React and the thinking behind it has been educational and rewarding for most web developers I know. It can open opportunities.</p>
<p>React is a success - in no place more than the contract developer job market. So much, that it threatens to overshadow other viable alternatives and skills for web developers. By becoming a <em>de facto</em> standard for interface development for the web, for <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">mobile</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/">VR</a>, I am sensing an assumption among managers and recruiters that JavaScript <em>is</em> React. We&#39;ve seen it happen in the past with jQuery - which was similarly enabling and educational for developers, but as a single dominant tool, was ultimately limiting. (See <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2015/04/jquery-considered-harmful/">jQuery considered harmful | Lea Verou</a>). I recognise the pattern from the rise and fall of Flash and ActionScript - which at the time exposed computational capabilities to creative and artistic contibutors who were left high and dry with the emergence of mobile and no place to go. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been observing the React bandwagon for a while now with a view to jumping on. But utimately bandwagons are not my thing. Like the many libraries and frameworks before it, React is just one of the options out there. Right now <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> is a viable alternative, among the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=react+alternatives">many others blooming daily</a>, that solve similar problems. And still more will be created to solve the unique problems we have yet to encounter. Right now I&#39;m watching <a href="https://svelte.technology/">Svelte • The magical disappearing UI framework</a>. </p>
<p>A dominant paradigm, no matter how good it is, will not solve every problem. Sometimes the answer lies outside the popular patterns, framework or language everyone is using right now. Developers must learn to solve deeper problems and understand what lies beneath - and a job market that expects a narrow skill set will produce shallow developers. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Single framework dominance is meta-level code smell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now it&#39;s React. But utimately it&#39;s JavaScript and more ultimately it&#39;s all computational - and further even more ultimately -  it&#39;s about how people, machines and data interact. React can serve us well for the problems React is good at helping us solve.  But to rely completely on a single tool will limit possibilities to the capabilities of that tool, and train us into a particular way of thinking.  We will be out of capable skills when new problems present themselves.</p>
<p>Learn React. Use React. React is good for right now. If you&#39;re a web developer you most likely need it right now. Many freelance contracts I see now currently require and assume knowledge of React.  I do think React is a genuine and worthy tool to know - but not to the exclusion of others.  </p>

For recruiters and managers it was an easy box to tick. It was a honey trap.</p>
<p>With time, my perceptions have evolved. React is probably more popular and dominant now than ever, but my fear of vendor lock-in has subsided. Using React daily at work has taught me new things about JavaScript.  I have grown to value its place in my UI developer toolbox.  More broadly I have grown to appreciate the React patterns and paradigms, and its ecosystem and the contribution its active communities make to my better use of JavaScript generally.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html">patterns that inform React&#39;s design</a>, and the approaches to using React have high interoperability with the rest of my tech stack. I am now more familiar with patterns like composition and other functional programming concepts. I now make better use of modern idiomatic JavaScript. I now understand better some of the design decisions and trade offs that go into developing a reactive UI with state management. These are not concepts unique to React. But React&#39;s role in bringing the conversations forward, and educating developers is clear.</p>
<p>I use React daily, but not exclusively.  I like to experiment with other frameworks and ideas. But I think I am a better developer for the presence of React in my universe, if I&#39;m using it or not.</p>
<p>Well for now, at least. Will check again in a couple years time…</p>

Reviewing it again now in 2015,  admataz has grown into a more formal business entity and I am working more directly with clients as opposed to daily freelance contract work.   I think this is still relevant to my approach to this site. </p>
<h3 id="this-is-my-web-site-and-heres-the-thinking-behind-it">This is my web site, and here’s the thinking behind it:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Original</strong>. The site reflects and records my ongoing ideas, expressions and professional work. This means regular subjective updates to the site content.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Experimental</strong>. The site code is created by me, using self-made tools over libraries and frameworks where I can. My personal site is an opportunity for learning, experimentation with my craft and developing core skills. This means regular unstable additions to the site functionality. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal and progressive</strong>. The site design, features and technology only contain what is needed. This means less structure, navigation and technical capacity. It also means less bloat. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Open</strong>. When I produce original code for this site, I expose it, explain it and share it. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Incomplete</strong>. It&#39;s never finished because there&#39;s always space for growth and new ideas.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mine</strong>. I am not a client or employer. I can do what I like, break the rules and be inefficient. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="content-and-structure-updates">Content and structure updates</h3>
<p>The initial change that was needed was <strong>content and structure</strong> - the site was out of date with where I am now professionaly. I have moved focus from being a self employed consultant, with <em>admataz the business</em> to a full-time remote developer working for <a href="https://nearform.com">NearForm</a>. Many of the client websites I worked on and that were part of my portfolio, case studies and showcase were getting out of date, or not relevant. The focus of my work life has changed, and <em>admataz the website</em> now lives on as my personal space to experiment, express and share. </p>
<h3 id="technical-updates">Technical updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>I rewrote <a href="https://npmjs.org/packages/blockstatic">Blockstatic</a> and released version <code>2.0</code> that is used to build this site&#39;s HTML.  Blockstatic is a node.js  static site generator I wrote to convert my source Markdown content files into the HTML for the site you are looking at right now. I modernised the JavaScript in Blockstatic, and added some new features. Hopefully this makes it even easier for me to add new content, and share some code and ideas</li>
<li>I reassembled the scrolly background boxes as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Component</a>, authored with <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte.js</a>. A long time ago in their first iteration, they were written with Ractive.js, and then updated as a React.js component - and now Svelte - kindof full circle. Same behaviour,  different libraries. </li>
<li>I&#39;ve cleaned up the site&#39;s javascript and removed any dependency on jQuery - and generally reduced the download sizes for pages. </li>
<li>With the changes in Blockstatic, I&#39;m able to embed images, scripts and styles for specific pages. This allows me to easily create showcase example pages containing modular javascript with specific style requirements, without polluting the global style or script objects - and that are downloaded on that page only. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-updates">Design updates</h3>
<p>Design is an ongoing exercise in shifting pixels. It&#39;s never complete. Things look a pretty much the same as they did in the previous site - I&#39;ve changed typefaces, and made things a bit better in mobile view. </p>
<div id="svg-logo"></div>

<p>If you want to compare - I&#39;ve kept the old site in the archive. You can see it <a href="https://archive2016.demo.admataz.com">here</a>. </p>

Climbing mountains is by definition uphill work - but equipped with frayed and knotted ropes and weighed by luggage this team had an extraordinary task ahead.</p>
<p>The expedition planners observed their party progress in a tedious ascent to the summit from Base Camp. From their vantage point they could just make out the individuals in the team. All eight... nine... or was that seven? It&#39;s difficult to see through the freezing fog. Who was leading again?</p>
<p>We had the partnership of hired sherpas. With their knowledge of the mountain they led us through the deepest gorges and across the sheerest cliffs into a series of criss-crossing patterns - dangerously close to the edge. Sometimes the ropes got tangled, and tempers would flare - but on the whole this crew stuck to their professional ethic and pushed on.</p>
<p>When I joined the team we set about strengthening our ropes - improving our knots - and looking at alternative routes and better tools that were certain to help the ascent. The maps we were provided were outdated so we redrew them. We went back to basic principles. We improved our climbing fitness. We studied new techniques. The experience was bonding - and we grew and supported each other through communication and learning. We felt stronger each day.</p>
<p>With each passing week, new and unexpected challenges would loom. Avalanches, snowstorms, and freezing fog. Oh, the freezing fog. We always rallied and saw our way through - always with the promise of better things to come.  But sometimes it felt like the instructions from Base Camp had us heading into the storm despite the warnings. Had we misunderstood something?</p>
<p>Eventually we lost an experienced and reliable climber. Then another, and another. Fresh recruits were sent to make up the numbers. It was imperative that we persevere with our mission and not deviate from the plan. And each new team member arrived with the same optimism and keen observation for improvement to the tools and routes and with their eye on the final destination.</p>
<p>Sometimes the summit looked closer, but mostly it was just an indistinct shadow in that freezing fog.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell the rest of this story, but by the time the seasons had turned full cycle I had abandoned that mountain and I had left my tools on a plateau somewhere for another climber to find and use on their ascent. Others felt they had been reduced to the luggage porters, and departed to join other teams where they could apply knowledge and skill.</p>
<p>The brave few that remained continued slowly and steadily, and the summit was eventually reached by a small party of four. At Base Camp there was reported wild celebration hero&#39;s welcome. The summit had been reached.</p>
<p>(Well done team. I know you&#39;re out there somewhere doing great things…)</p>

<p>Since 2010 I have been working closely with the digital communications team at The Elders, developing and maintaining their website at <a href="http://theelders.org">TheElders.org</a>. The website reflects their ongoing global initiatives and activities, and provides an historical depth of information for visitors to find out more about the individuals and the organisation. </p>
<p>In late 2014 we launched a new version of the site, building on the successful design and architecture we had developed in earlier iterations.  This new version was an upgrade from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7, and included a fresh custom theme with mobile responsiveness. We improved the UX of the site and provided a range of CMS tools to better manage the diverse content. </p>
