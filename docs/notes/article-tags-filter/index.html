      Using Drupal to build a faceted navigation and tag-based filtering.

    <div class="page-body">
    <p>A site that publishes articles regularly can, over time, bury older relevant content.</p>
<p>Here I explain the information architecture and server-side technical challenges I faced setting up new organisational structures in a Drupal site to tackle the issue of accessing older content.</p>
<h2 id="drupals-taxonomy-system">Drupal&#39;s taxonomy system</h2>
<p>Drupal makes it easy to tag and categorise content using Drupal&#39;s native taxonomy module. Custom vocabularies, Taxonomy Fields, and Content Types provide the tools to design a fluid and emergent &#39;bottom-up&#39; organisation to content: structure emerges from the qualities and properties of the content.</p>
<p>Providing end-user access to this fluid structure is less straight forward. While a list of all content tagged with a single particular term works easily out the box, getting combinations of multiple terms is not. We needed to provide a list of articles of Type A, that cover Topic B, and have been tagged with Tag X, Y and Z.</p>
<h2 id="a-form-of-faceted-classification">A form of Faceted classification</h2>
<p>Information architects call what we are trying to do &#39;Faceted classification&#39; - topics expose &#39;facets&#39; to a body of content, and combinations of topics quickly reveal the intersections, and help users to cut a large body of content down to the relevant items.  </p>
<p>Technically in the relational database world behind Drupal, this involves composing a series of joins in our queries that return the relevant content nodes. We wrote a custom module to do this the way we wanted.</p>
<h2 id="we-want-nice-urls">We want nice URLs</h2>
<p>Foremost in our decision to write our own custom module was the importance of meaningful URLs. The Views module supports multiple arguments in a Taxonomy-based query - but they need to be numeric  - something along the line of <code>/filter-base/123+234+321</code> We wanted URLs to reflect the content and context being queried, something more like <code>/filter-base/type-a/topic-x/tag-y</code>.</p>
<h2 id="nodes-as-context-bases">Nodes as context bases</h2>
<p>We also wanted to be able to attach this &#39;contextualised&#39; capability to nodes within the site structure, so we could do something along the lines of <code>/main-topic-node/any/combination/of/topics</code> where &#39;main-topic-node&#39; is a normal page node, and the URL segments provide the basis to produce a list of relevant and filtered articles for that node. These main topic nodes were to be managed by editors via the CMS (ruling out custom <code>hook_menu()</code> implementations), and to sit at the first segment of the URL.  </p>
<p>Drupal does not make this kind of dynamic URL routing easy. The path module will map a user-friendly URL to an internal path (like <code>node/123</code>), but doesn&#39;t support adding parameters after the path.</p>
<h2 id="our-custom-drupal-module-for-providing-contextual-base-nodes-and-url-parameters-for-filtering-content">Our custom Drupal module for providing contextual base nodes and URL parameters for filtering content</h2>
<p>To simplify slightly, our custom module does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <code>hook_install()</code> it defines new custom fields that allow us to define whether a node should act as a &#39;contextual base&#39; to lists of other nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In <code>hook_menu()</code> we gather all nodes with the above &#39;contextual base&#39; flag set, and override the menu callback with a custom function. To keep this up to date, it&#39;s worth rebuilding the menu when saving nodes of the type that could be contextual bases.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With a custom route and callback defined, we are able to access extra segments in the URL as parameters, and use them to run queries against the <code>taxonomy_term_data</code> and <code>taxonomy_index</code> tables to get a list of relevant nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We add the list of relevant nodes to the current node as a property, that can then be picked up in theme templates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In our development of the module, we also added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>integration with search, so users could search within a context</p>
</li>
<li><p>and we generated lists of links for the selected and  available taxonomy terms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the additions in this last point, we were able to provide a faceted navigation to the content of the site. Users could select relevant terms from the various vocabularies, and the page would refresh with a shorter list of articles, a shorter list of remaining terms relevant to the results, and the list of selected terms (also reflected in the URL path). It made it very quick to drill down to a specific cross section of site content, and provided an intuitive interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting here that URLs are being generated with segments in any order but providing the same content. So <code>/type-a/topic-x/tag-y</code> would produce exactly the same page results as <code>/topic-x/tag-y/type-a</code>. This is not such a problem from a user&#39;s perspective, but isn&#39;t good for SEO. We need to define a canonical path for search engines to avoid penalisation here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="next-steps-improvements-to-the-client-side">Next steps: improvements to the client-side</h2>
<p>All this is good, but we found there is room for improvement:  The full page refresh for each click of a tag feels like an expensive investment for users so we started looking at ways to load the results faster...</p>
<p>In Part Two we explain how we overhauled this feature to provide a fast-loading interface using Backbone.js.  </p>
