    <h1>React is still everywhere.</h1>

    <div class="intro">
      Two and a half years ago I noted my fears of a dominant JavaScript framework. My thoughts have evolved and I feel a little better about it now.
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-body">
    <p>When I wrote about <a href="/notes/react-everywhere">problems I perceived with React.js</a> in 2017, I saw it as a potentially over-dominant paradigm in the minds and activities of web developers. For recruiters and managers it was an easy box to tick. It was a honey trap.</p>
<p>With time, my perceptions have evolved. React is probably more popular and dominant now than ever, but my fear of vendor lock-in has subsided. Using React daily at work has taught me new things about JavaScript.  I have grown to value its place in my UI developer toolbox.  More broadly I have grown to appreciate the React patterns and paradigms, and its ecosystem and the contribution its active communities make to my better use of JavaScript generally.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html">patterns that inform React&#39;s design</a>, and the approaches to using React have high interoperability with the rest of my tech stack. I am now more familiar with patterns like composition and other functional programming concepts. I now make better use of modern idiomatic JavaScript. I now understand better some of the design decisions and trade offs that go into developing a reactive UI with state management. These are not concepts unique to React. But React&#39;s role in bringing the conversations forward, and educating developers is clear.</p>
<p>I use React daily, but not exclusively.  I like to experiment with other frameworks and ideas. But I think I am a better developer for the presence of React in my universe, if I&#39;m using it or not.</p>
<p>Well for now, at least. Will check again in a couple years time…</p>
